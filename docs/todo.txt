- remove IOException

- how to quit the app?
- should I model user at this point (even as tiny type)?
- add time ago
- trim input
- make return of command.execute Optional

#uhm... errm...
- equals/hashcode on Commands just to test
- is there really no better way to use regexes in java?
- should i put command parsing logic in CommandParser or in Command objects?
- should we have a Post object
- should commands return String or something more generic like Serializable?
- should timestamp creation happen in command or in post object?

# known issues
- "moments ago" instead of x seconds ago
